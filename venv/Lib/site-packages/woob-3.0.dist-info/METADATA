Woob
====


Woob is a project which provides a core library, modules and applications.

## Overview

The core library defines capabilities: features common to various websites.
For example, [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/) and
[Dailymotion](http://www.dailymotion.com/) both provide videos; Woob defines
the `CapVideo` capability for them.

Each module interfaces with a website and implements one or many of these
capabilities. Modules can be configured (becoming a "backend"), which means
that the end-user can provide personal information to access the underlying
website, like a login and password.

Applications allow the end-user to work with many modules in parallel,
in a multi-threaded way. For example, one could search a video on
many websites at once. Applications are toolkit-agnostic. They can use GTK+,
Qt or be text-only. The latter can be used either in an interactive way
or in pipes.

The core library provides base classes which help developers write
modules and applications.
